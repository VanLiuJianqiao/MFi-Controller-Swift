# MFi-Controller-Swift

This project enables you to program on the MFi Controller (e.g. SteelSeries Nimbus)

I basically learned from https://github.com/versluis/MFi-Controller and https://cartoonsmart.com/how-to-support-external-game-controllers-with-swift-2-and-sprite-kit-for-the-new-apple-tv/ and made a Swift 3 version of the MFi Controller
